						People have been using tools with varying levels of complexity to make math

						for logorithms. However, these technologies only went so far in that they had singular
						purposes and their scope was limited by the space they occupied, and as the Industrial
						Revolution kicked up and global trade started to expand, it became more imperative
						to get engineers and navigators the appropriate tables of equations so they could
						do their jobs well. These were difficult to reproduce accurately, and folks were
						feeling the pain. In classic infomercial style, THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER A BETTER WAY.

						However, as far as the British government was concerned, human error still reigned

						actually be built out until 1989 when it was basically done for fun by the London Science Museum
						Also to their chagrin, Babbage had gotten distracted by another project in 1837 –
						an analytical engine that could be used more broadly, had "memory", and could grapple with
						loops and conditional branching.

				<section>
					<h1>How Do Computers Do Their Thinking?</h1>

					<aside class="notes">
						... once digital computers arrived, the base on which computers did
						all of their thinking, colloquially referred to as “memory,” stabilized
						into three forms, . It operates a little differently from human memory,
						but I'll try to make it as clear as possible.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<!-- How Do Computers Do Their Thinking: ROM -->

					<section>
						<h2>How Computers Think: ROM</h2>
						<p>
							<strong class="blue">ROM</strong>, or <strong class="blue">Read-Only Memory</strong>, is hardwritten
							into chips and handles data essential to a computer's operation.
						</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							ROM, or read-only memory, is memory that’s hardwritten onto chips. This kind of
							memory is typically responsible for serving up the kind of data that’s your
							computer would be hard-pressed to operate without — like an operating system.
							Of course, making it quick to access means that files in it can’t be edited,
							and means that your computer won’t forget how to operate when it’s turned off.

							Do we have any gamers in our midst? Or been down to 16-Bit?
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>How Computers Think: ROM</h2>
						<small>Cartridge-based video games are a small example of read-only memory.</small>
						<img src="img/slide-images/rom-cartridge.png" alt="A dissected Game Boy game cartridge.">

						<aside class="notes">
							In the arcade and early home gaming eras, games were printed as read-only memory onto
							chips and read directly and immediately by their computer systems. One of the pitfalls
							of writing data to ROM is that space is limited to what you can physically place on the
							chips, which is why you don't see many cartridges in use nowadays.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>How Computers Think: ROM</h2>
						<img src="img/slide-images/supermarioworld.gif" alt="A screenshot of Super Mario World.">

						<aside class="notes">
							It did, however, make these games run at a very snappy pace, which is why we may have
							had to suffer through replaying levels in older games, it wasn't paired with the
							indignity of having to sit through a loading screen like we do with games on discs.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>How Computers Think: ROM</h2>
						<small><strong class="blue">Read-Only Memory</strong> functions similarly to the brainstem.</small>
						<img src="img/slide-images/heavy-breathing-cat.gif" alt="A fat cat with the caption 'heavy breathing' breathes heavily.">
						<small style="display: block;" class="fragment">(I'm sorry...)</small>
					</section>

					<aside class="notes">
						In a computer, it operates a bit like your brain stem — taking care of activities
						that are necessary to life so you don’t have to spend all of your thinking on
						performing them, like breathing. I am sorry if you are now thinking about breathing
						and actively doing it right now.
					</aside>

				<!-- How Do Computers Do Their Thinking: Hard Drive Memory -->

					<section>
						<h2>How Computers Think: <br>Hard Drive Memory</h2>
						<p>
							<strong class="blue">Hard Drive Memory</strong> is editable memory that
							holds files and programs that you create and install.
						</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							Hard drive memory — not explicitly named as memory, but still, technically memory, holds files and
							programs on your computer that you create and install. While ROM is fixed, memory on your hard drive
							can be written and edited, which makes it very much like long-term memory. When you “save” files,
							you’re writing them to your hard drive. Flash drives, similarly, are a type of hard drive memory.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>How Computers Think: <br>Hard Drive Memory</h2>
						<img src="img/slide-images/insideout.jpeg" alt="The Emotions from Inside Out">

						<aside class="notes">
							The human analogue of this type of computer memory is long-term
							memory. If you’ve seen the movie Inside Out, the way in which memories
							are stored is actually pretty similar to how computers hold onto data.
						</aside>

				<!-- How Do Computers Do Their Thinking: RAM -->

						<h2>How Computers Think: RAM</h2>
						<img class="fragment" src="img/slide-images/random-access-memories.jpg" alt="The cover of Daft Punk's Random Access Memories.">

						<h2>How Computers Think: RAM</h2>

							<strong class="blue">RAM</strong>, or <strong class="blue">Random Access Memory</strong>
							is volatile memory that handles data that the computer is actively using.

						<img class="fragment" src="img/slide-images/RAM.png" alt="A diagram of the process of RAM encoding.">

						<aside class="notes">
							... is volatile — the data it grapples with isn’t ‘written’
							anywhere, just temporarily stored on a series of capacitors that are electrified
							to hold bits of data as zeros and ones, “on" representing one, “off" representing
							zero. These capacitors deal with what you’re actively working on on the computer —
							whether that’s data that has yet to be saved, or your computer reading something
							from the hard drive. The more capacitors you have, the more your computer
							is able to do at once.

							Has anyone had their computer crash and lost hours worth of work before?

					</section>

					<section data-background="img/slide-images/dawsoncrying.gif">
						<!-- A picture of a cartoon dog in a burning house staying put and
								saying "This is fine." -->
						<aside class="notes">
							This is RAM's fault.
							Yes, dear friends — this is why there’s a whole lot of weeping and your recent
							work to files is lost to the ether in the case of a computer crash — your RAM
							doesn’t suddenly loses context and you’re left with a blank slate.
						</aside>

					<section>
						<h2>How Computers Think: RAM</h2>
						<img src="img/slide-images/50firstdates.jpg" alt="Confused Drew Barrymore sitting next to Adam Sandler.">

						<aside class="notes">
							Computers are very much like Drew Barrymore's character in 50 First Dates —
							doomed to lose any "new" memories whenever she loses consciousness. Both tragic,
							and a blessing in that, as far as she knows, Adam Sandler's filmography ends
							in the year 2003.

							Fortunately, a lot of programs do some stealth-saving in the background
							and provide you with recovery files, but that pain and terror is a part of RAM.
						</aside>

					<section>
						<h2>How Computers Think: RAM</h2>
						<p>
							<strong class="blue">RAM</strong> is like our working memory.
						</p>
						<img class="fragment" src="img/slide-images/jenny.gif" style="height: 40vh" alt="Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope looking disgusted with herself.">

						<aside class="notes">
							In this way, RAM is quite a bit like working memory. If you meet someone and
							exchange telephone numbers, it’s likely that you’ll forget those 7-10 digits
							when you’re provided with additional distraction unless you make a conscious
							choice to memorize that phone number. Meanwhile, Tommy Tutone has ensured that
							most people of a certain age remember Jenny’s phone number.

						Another side benefit of this course I forgot to mention is that a little bit

						Can anyone parse what the highlighted items indicate?

						There is a caveat, being that colloquially, “memory” refers to RAM.

					<aside class="notes">
						When digital computers actually started being made, they ultimately

							Some of of you may remember variables from algebra — but if any of
							you have some post-traumatic stress from this time, fear not —
							there's no need to solve for anything, variables are our friends,

							code. The computer will be manipulating all of your variables,
							you will just be telling it how.

							There are a few different types of information that can be stored

# Alternatively...
number_of_cars = 276

while number_of_cars > 0:

          <h2>Beware the Infinite Loop!</h2>
            <p>An <strong class="blue">infinite loop</strong> is a loop that will never meet the condition to stop.<br> It will keep going until it's used up all your computer's (or server's) memory (RAM). This is bad!</p>

              <ul class="small">
                <li>If the <span class='code-fragment'><code>papers_to_deliver = papers_to_deliver - 1</code></span> line was missing, it would keep looping because 65 is always greater than 0!</li>
                <li>If <span class='code-fragment'><code>papers_to_deliver = papers_to_deliver - 1</code></span> was changed to <span class='code-fragment'><code>+ 1</code></span>, it would keep adding 1 to 65 forever!</li>
