							all of their thinking did stabilize into three forms, colloquially referred
							to as “memory”. It operates a little differently from human memory, but a

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>How Computers Think: ROM</h2>
						<p>
							<strong class="blue">ROM</strong>, or <strong class="blue">Read-Only Memory</strong>, is hardwritten
							into chips and handles data essential to a computer's operation.
						</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							ROM, or read-only memory, is memory that’s hardwritten onto chips. This kind of
							memory is typically responsible for serving up the kind of data that’s your
							computer would be hard-pressed to operate without — like an operating system.
							Of course, making it quick to access means that files in it can’t be edited,
							and means that your computer won’t forget how to operate when it’s turned off.

							Do we have any gamers in our midst? Or been down to 16-Bit?
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>How Computers Think: ROM</h2>
						<small>Cartridge-based video games are a small example of read-only memory.</small>
						<img src="img/slide-images/rom-cartridge.png" alt="A dissected Game Boy game cartridge.">

						<aside class="notes">
							In the arcade and early home gaming eras, games were printed as read-only memory onto
							chips and read directly and immediately by their computer systems. One of the pitfalls
							of writing data to ROM is that space is limited to what you can physically place on the
							chips, which is why you don't see many cartridges in use nowadays.
						</aside>

						<h2>How Computers Think: ROM</h2>

							It did, however, make these games run at a very snappy pace, which is why we may have
							had to suffer through replaying levels in older games, it wasn't paired with the
							indignity of having to sit through a loading screen like we do with games on discs.

					<aside class="notes">
						In a computer, it operates a bit like your brain stem — taking care of activities
						that are necessary to life so you don’t have to spend all of your thinking on
						performing them, like breathing. I am sorry if you are now thinking about breathing
						and actively doing it right now.

				<!-- How Do Computers Do Their Thinking: Hard Drive Memory -->

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>How Computers Think: <br>Hard Drive Memory</h2>
						<p>
							<strong class="blue">Hard Drive Memory</strong> is editable memory that
							holds files and programs that you create and install.
						</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							Hard drive memory — not explicitly named as memory, but still, technically memory, holds files and
							programs on your computer that you create and install. While ROM is fixed, memory on your hard drive
							can be written and edited, which makes it very much like long-term memory. When you “save” files,
							you’re writing them to your hard drive. Flash drives, similarly, are a type of hard drive memory.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>How Computers Think: <br>Hard Drive Memory</h2>
						<img src="img/slide-images/insideout.jpeg" alt="The Emotions from Inside Out">

						<aside class="notes">
							The human analogue of this type of computer memory is long-term
							memory. If you’ve seen the movie Inside Out, the way in which memories
							are stored is actually pretty similar to how computers hold onto data.

						<aside class="notes">
							... is volatile — the data it grapples with isn’t ‘written’
							anywhere, just temporarily stored on a series of capacitors that are electrified
							to hold bits of data as zeros and ones, “on" representing one, “off" representing
							zero. These capacitors deal with what you’re actively working on on the computer —
							whether that’s data that has yet to be saved, or your computer reading something
							from the hard drive. The more capacitors you have, the more your computer
							is able to do at once.

							Has anyone had their computer crash and lost hours worth of work before?

					<section data-background="img/slide-images/dawsoncrying.gif">
						<!-- A picture of a cartoon dog in a burning house staying put and

						<aside class="notes">
							This is RAM's fault.
							Yes, dear friends — this is why there’s a whole lot of weeping and your recent
							work to files is lost to the ether in the case of a computer crash — your RAM
							doesn’t suddenly loses context and you’re left with a blank slate.
						</aside>

					<section>
						<h2>How Computers Think: RAM</h2>
						<img src="img/slide-images/50firstdates.jpg" alt="Confused Drew Barrymore sitting next to Adam Sandler.">

						<aside class="notes">
							Computers are very much like Drew Barrymore's character in 50 First Dates —
							doomed to lose any "new" memories whenever she loses consciousness. Both tragic,
							and a blessing in that, as far as she knows, Adam Sandler's filmography ends
							in the year 2003.

							Fortunately, a lot of programs do some stealth-saving in the background
							and provide you with recovery files, but that pain and terror is a part of RAM.

						<h2>How Computers Think: RAM</h2>

						</p>
						<img class="fragment" src="img/slide-images/jenny.gif" style="height: 40vh" alt="Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope looking disgusted with herself.">

						<aside class="notes">
							In this way, RAM is quite a bit like working memory. If you meet someone and
							exchange telephone numbers, it’s likely that you’ll forget those 7-10 digits
							when you’re provided with additional distraction unless you make a conscious
							choice to memorize that phone number. Meanwhile, Tommy Tutone has ensured that
							most people of a certain age remember Jenny’s phone number.

					<aside class="notes">
						When digital computers actually started being made, they ultimately

					<aside class="notes">
						Assembly code… looks vaguely better than a sweep of binary.

						Since then, languages have continued to become more abstracted and

						between the third and fourth generations outside of some changes in how
						stored data interacts with programs, this started happening around the
						mid-80s, incidentally as the web was coming into its own. But by this
						time, there's a clear interest in making languages as clear as possible
						to programmers, which is very nicely summed up in the philosophy of the
						creator of Ruby, Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, who hoped "to see Ruby help
						every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming,
						and to be happy." which, as far as goals go, is both noble and adorable.

						If we popped back to Amazon, we could say "IF" you're logged in, show your name and cart numbers.
						"ELSE", show a link to the login page. Also, "IF" you're an Amazon Prime member, you get free shipping!

					<h2>Let's Talk To Computers: Loops</h2>
					<p>A loop is a <strong class="blue">set of instructions that repeats</strong><br/>until a certain condition is reached.</p>
					<p>Two kinds of loops are <b class="blue">For Loops</b> and <b class="blue">While Loops</b>.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Why Use Loops?</h2>
							<p>Loops are awesome at doing repetitive tasks and reducing the amount of code you need to write.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							Depending on what you're doing, you could have hundreds of lines of
							code using if/then/else, or you could write a simple loop statement.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Why Use Loops?</h2>

						<pre><code contenteditable class="python">print('You get a car!')
# ... 275 lines later...
print('You get a car!')

# Alternatively...
number_of_cars = 276

while number_of_cars > 0:
	print('You get a car!')
	number_of_cars = number_of_cars - 1
</code></pre>

						<aside class="notes">
							If Oprah were a computer, she could say, "You get a car! And you get
							a car! And you get a car!" 276 times for each member of her studio
							audience... or she could rapidly loop through the entire studio audience.
							to do the same thing.

          <h2>Beware the Infinite Loop!</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>An <strong class="blue">infinite loop</strong> is a loop that will never meet the condition to stop. It will keep going until it's used up all your computer's (or server's) memory (RAM). This is bad!</li>
            <li>Example for our loop:
              <ul class="small">
                <li>If the <code>papers_to_deliver = papers_to_deliver - 1</code> line was missing, it would keep looping because 65 is always greater than 0!</li>
                <li>If <code>papers_to_deliver = papers_to_deliver - 1</code> was changed to <code>+ 1</code>, it would keep adding 1 to 65 forever!</li>

          <p>When companies implement a new program,<br/>they take various things into consideration:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Possible languages to use:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Python: computer program</li>
              <li>SQL: manage the data</li>

            <li>Programming structures:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Variables: place to store the information such as, colors, amounts, etc.</li>
              <li>Detailed steps to tell the computer what to do.</li>
